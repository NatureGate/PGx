<p>Dosing recommendations only apply to higher initial doses of TCAs for treatment of conditions such as depression. See other considerations for dosing recommendations for conditions where lower initial doses are used, such as neuropathic pain. TCAs without major CYP2C19 metabolism include the secondary amines nortriptyline and desipramine. Utilizing therapeutic drug monitoring if a tricyclic is prescribed to a patient with CYP2D6 ultrarapid, intermediate or poor metabolism in combination with CYP2C19 ultrarapid, intermediate or poor metabolism is strongly recommended.</p>

Achieving voriconazole therapeutic concentrations in the pediatric population with ultrarapid and rapid metabolizer phenotypes in a timely manner is difficult. As critical time may be lost in achieving therapeutic concentrations, an alternative antifungal agent is recommended in order that the child receives effective antifungal therapy as soon as possible. Meticulous TDM is critical for rapid metabolizers. There is insufficient evidence to distinguish a CYP2C19*1/*17 and *1/*1 pediatric patient due to large variability in trough concentrations.</p>

<p>If it is not possible to avoid tioguanine: use 10% of the standard dose and advise patients to seek medical attention when symptoms of myelosuppression (such as severe sore throat in combination with fever, regular nosebleeds and tendency to bruising) occur. Any adjustment of the initial dose should be guided by toxicity (monitoring of blood counts) and efficacy. Monitoring should be performed at an increased frequency.</p>
<p>NOTE: The percentage of 10% is based on the analogy with azathioprine and mercaptopurine and the analogy with TPMT, for which the gene variants have a comparable effect on toxicity to those of NUDT15. For NUDT15 PM, a percentage of &lt; 20% was calculated for azathioprine and mercaptopurine, but there were insufficient data available to calculate the exact percentage.
NOTE: Dose adjustment based on the total of 6-TGN metabolites is not possible for these patients, as they develop toxicity within the therapeutic range that applies for patients without gene variants.</p>
