<p>There is no need to avoid prescribing of atazanavir based on UGT1A1 genetic test result.

<h4 id="other-considerations">Other Considerations</h4>
<p>All studies correlating UGT1A1 genotypes with atazanavir adverse events have involved ritonavir boosting. However, concentration-time profiles are equivalent when boosted with either cobicistat or ritonavir (PMID 23532097), and bilirubin-related adverse events including discontinuation of atazanavir occur in a similar percentage of patients prescribed atazanavir with cobicistat or ritonavir (PMID 23532097). Associations between UGT1A1 genotype, bilirubin elevations, and atazanavir/r discontinuation therefore almost certainly translate to atazanavir/cobicistat. &quot;reference&quot; function refers to the UGT1A1 allele to which other alleles are compared.</p>

Poor metabolizer status is associated with lower final dose requirements as compared to non-poor metabolizers.
<p>Initiate with a dose of 40 mg/day and increase to 80 mg/day after 3 days. If no clinical response and in the absence of adverse events after 2 weeks, consider increasing dose to 100 mg/day. If no clinical response observed after 2 weeks, consider obtaining a peak plasma concentration (1 to 2 hours after dose administered). If &lt;200 ng/mL, consider a proportional increase in dose to approach 400 ng/mL. Dosages greater than 100 mg/day may be needed to achieve target concentrations.</p>
<h4 id="other-considerations">Other Considerations</h4>
<p>Therapeutic range of 200 to 1000 ng/mL has been proposed (PMID 29493375). Limited data are available regarding the relationship between atomoxetine plasma concentrations and clinical response. Available information suggests that clinical response is greater in poor metabolizers (PMs) compared to non-PMs and may be related to the higher plasma concentrations 1 to 1.5 hours after dosing in PMs compared to non-PMs administered a similar dose. Furthermore, modest improvement in response, defined as reduction in ADHD-rating scale, is observed at peak concentrations greater than 400 ng/mL. Doses above 120 mg/day have not been evaluated.</p>
	CYP2D6: Normal metabolizers of atomoxetine have a lower likelihood of response as compared to poor metabolizers. This is associated with increased discontinuation due to lack of efficacy as compared to poor metabolizers.

<p>HLA-B*15:02 has a 100% negative predictive value for carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN, and its use is currently recommended to guide use of carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine only. Because there is a much weaker association and less than 100% negative predictive value of HLA-B*15:02 for SJS/TEN associated with other aromatic anticonvulsants, using these drugs instead of carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine in the setting of a negative HLA-B*15:02 test in Southeast Asians will not result in prevention of anticonvulsant-associated SJS/TEN (PMID 25355835).</p>
	HLA-A: n/a;HLA-B: Normal risk of carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN
<p>If patient is carbamazepine-naïve and alternative agents are not available, consider the use of carbamazepine with increased frequency of clinical monitoring. Discontinue therapy at first evidence of a cutaneous adverse reaction.</p>
	HLA-A: Greater risk of carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN, DRESS, and MPE;HLA-B: n/a
<p>The latency period for drug-induced SJS/TEN is short with continuous dosing and adherence to therapy (~4-28 days), and cases usually occur within three months of dosing; therefore, if the patient has previously used carbamazepine consistently for longer than three months without incidence of cutaneous adverse reactions, cautiously consider use of carbamazepine in the future.</p>

<p>Consider alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2C19; If doxepin is warranted, utilize therapeutic drug monitoring to guide dose adjustment. Utilizing therapeutic drug monitoring to guide dose adjustments is strongly recommended.</p>
<h4 id="other-considerations">Other Considerations</h4>
<p>Dosing recommendations only apply to higher initial doses of TCAs for treatment of conditions such as depression. See other considerations for dosing recommendations for conditions where lower initial doses are used, such as neuropathic pain. TCAs without major CYP2C19 metabolism include the secondary amines nortriptyline and desipramine. Utilizing therapeutic drug monitoring if a tricyclic is prescribed to a patient with CYP2D6 ultrarapid, intermediate or poor metabolism in combination with CYP2C19 ultrarapid, intermediate or poor metabolism is strongly recommended.</p>
	CYP2C19: Increased metabolism of tertiary amines compared to normal metabolizers; Greater conversion of tertiary amines to secondary amines may affect response or side effects;CYP2D6: Reduced metabolism of TCAs to less active compounds compared to normal metabolizers; Higher plasma concentrations of active drug will increase the probability of side effects

<p>Initiate efavirenz with standard dosing (600 mg/day)</p>
<h4 id="other-considerations">Other Considerations</h4>
<p>The ENCORE study showed that in treatment-naïve patients randomized to initiate efavirenz-based regimens (combined with tenofovir and emtricitabine), 400 mg/day was non-inferior to 600 mg/day regardless of CYP2B6 genotype (PMID 24522178).</p>
	CYP2B6: Normal efavirenz metabolism
<p>Consider initiating efavirenz with decreased dose of 400 mg/day</p>
<h4 id="other-considerations">Other Considerations</h4>
<p>If therapeutic drug monitoring is available and a decreased efavirenz dose is prescribed, consider obtaining steady-state plasma efavirenz concentrations to ensure concentrations are in the suggested therapeutic range (~1 to 4 μg/mL). To prescribe efavirenz at a decreased dose of 400 mg/day or 200 mg/day in a multidrug regimen may require prescribing more than one pill once daily. If so, the provider should weigh the potential benefit of reduced dose against the potential detrimental impact of increased pill number.</p>
	CYP2B6: Higher dose-adjusted trough concentrations of efavirenz compared with normal metabolizers; increased risk of CNS adverse events

	DPYD: Normal DPD activity and "normal" risk for fluoropyrimidine toxicity
<p>Reduce starting dose by 50% followed by titration of dose based on toxicity or therapeutic drug monitoring (if available).</p>
<h4 id="other-considerations">Other Considerations</h4>
<p>Increase the dose in patients experiencing no or clinically tolerable toxicity in the first two cycles to maintain efficacy; decrease the dose in patients who do not tolerate the starting dose to minimize toxicities.</p>
	DPYD: Decreased DPD activity (leukocyte DPD activity at 30% to 70% that of the normal population) and increased risk for severe or even fatal drug toxicity when treated with fluoropyrimidine drugs
<p>Reduce starting dose by 50% followed by titration of dose based on toxicity or therapeutic drug monitoring (if available). Patients with the c.2846A&gt;T/c.2846A&gt;T genotype may require &gt;50% reduction in starting dose.</p>

<p>Avoid use of 5-fluorouracil or 5-fluorouracil prodrug-based regimens.</p>
	DPYD: Complete DPD deficiency and increased risk for severe or even fatal drug toxicity when treated with fluoropyrimidine drugs.
<p>Avoid use of 5-fluorouracil or 5-fluorouracil prodrug-based regimens. In the event, based on clinical advice, alternative agents are not considered a suitable therapeutic option, 5-fluorouracil should be administered at a strongly reduced dose with early therapeutic drug monitoring.</p>
<h4 id="other-considerations">Other Considerations</h4>
<p>If available, a phenotyping test (see main text for further details) should be considered to estimate the starting dose. In absence of phenotyping data, a dose of &lt;25% of the normal starting dose is estimated assuming additive effects of alleles on 5-FU clearance. Therapeutic drug monitoring should be done at the earliest time point possible (e.g., minimum time point in steady state) in order to immediately discontinue therapy if the drug level is too high.</p>

<p>Based on TPMT status, start with reduced starting doses (30%-80% of normal dose) if normal starting dose is ≥ 75 mg/m2/day or ≥ 1.5 mg/kg/day (e.g., start at 22.5-60 mg/m2/day or 0.45-1.2 mg/kg/day) and adjust doses of mercaptopurine based on degree of myelosuppression and disease-specific guidelines. Allow 2-4 weeks to reach steady-state after each dose adjustment. If myelosuppression occurs, and depending on other therapy, emphasis should be on reducing mercaptopurine over other agents (PMID 20354201,18685564, 8857546, 18987654, 20010622, 16401827, 11302950, 16530532, 9634537).

<h4 id="other-considerations">Other Considerations</h4>
<p>Other aromatic anticonvulsants have weaker evidence linking SJS/TEN with the HLA-B*15:02 allele; however, caution should still be used in choosing an alternative agent. Aromatic anticonvulsants include carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, and phenobarbital.</p>
	HLA-B: Greater risk of oxcarbazepine-induced SJS/TEN
<p>Use oxcarbazepine per standard dosing guidelines.</p>
	HLA-B: Normal risk of oxcarbazepine-induced SJS/TEN
<p>The latency period for drug-induced SJS/TEN is short with continuous dosing and adherence to therapy (~4-28 days), and cases usually occur within three months of dosing; therefore, if the patient has previously used oxcarbazepine consistently for longer than three months without incidence of cutaneous adverse reactions, cautiously consider use of oxcarbazepine in the future.</p>
<h4 id="other-considerations">Other Considerations</h4>
<p>Previous tolerance of oxcarbazepine is not indicative of tolerance to other aromatic anticonvulsants. Aromatic anticonvulsants include carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, and phenobarbital.</p>

	An INR ≥ 6, resulting in an increased risk of bleeding, occurs in 8-12% of these patients during the first weeks of treatment with standard regulation by the Anticoagulation Clinic. The genetic variation increases the sensitivity to acenocoumarol.
<p>NO action is needed for this gene-drug interaction.</p>
	The genetic variation results in a reduction of the required dose, but with the current practice of initiating or reviewing treatment this results in little or no increased risk of
bleeding or excessive anticoagulation.

	The effectiveness of allopurinol is reduced, meaning that a higher dose is required. The gene variation reduces the excretion of uric acid by kidneys and intestines, meaning that a stronger inhibition of the uric acid production by allopurinol is required to achieve the desired uric acid concentration.

<li>
<p>Another option is to induce allopurinol tolerance first: To induce allopurinol tolerance, the allopurinol dose is increased every 3 days until a dose of 100 mg/day has been achieved on Day 28. The consecutive daily doses in the
induction protocol are 50 µg, 100 µg, 200 µg, 500 µg, 1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg.</p>

<p>Indication OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER or ANXIETY DISORDERS: avoid clomipramine. Antidepressants that are not metabolised by CYP2C19 - or to a lesser extent - include, for example, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and paroxetine. If it is not possible to avoid clomipramine: monitor the effect and side effects or the plasma concentrations of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine. For obsessive compulsive disorder, the therapeutic plasma concentration of clomipramine is greater than 200 ng/mL in combination with a plasma concentration of desmethylclomipramine that is as low as possible. For anxiety disorders, the therapeutic plasma concentration of clomipramine is approximately 100 ng/mL in combination with a plasma concentration of desmethylclomipramine lower than 200 ng/mL. A sum of the plasma concentrations of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine exceeding 600 ng/mL is considered toxic. Add a low dose of fluvoxamine if necessary, to inhibit CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 and thereby inhibit the conversion of clomipramine to desmethylclomipramine. Indication DEPRESSION: no action required</p>
	The gene variation increases the risk of ineffectiveness for obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety disorders by reducing the plasma concentration of clomipramine.

<p>Efavirenz in MONOpreparation, adults and children FROM 40 KG: Body mass index LESS THAN or EQUAL to 25: 1. The recommended initial dose is 400 mg/day and this dose should be titrated to plasma concentration if needed (further reduction to 200 mg/day or in rare cases an increase to 600 mg/day). The therapeutic range established for efavirenz is 1000-4000 ng/ml. Body mass index GREATER than 25: 1. The recommended initial dose is 600 mg/day and this dose should be titrated to plasma concentration if needed (reduction to 400 or 200 mg/day). The therapeutic range established for efavirenz is 1000-4000 ng/ml.
*Efavirenz in MONOpreparation, children LIGHTER THAN 40 KG: 1. Start with the standard dose and titrate this dose to plasma concentration if needed. In adults, therapeutic plasma concentrations were achieved at either 2/3rd of the standard dose (1/3rd of the patients) or 1/3rd of the standard dose (2/3rd of the patients). In children younger than 3 years, therapeutic plasma concentrations were achieved at doses of approximately 10 mg/kg per day (as capsules) (100 mg/day for 7-14 kg and 150 mg/day for 14-17 kg; 50-75% of the standard dose). The therapeutic range established for efavirenz is 1000-4000 ng/ml.
*Efavirenz in COMBINATION preparation: 1. Initiate the combination preparation and titrate the efavirenz dose to plasma concentration if needed (reduction to 400 or 200 mg/day) The therapeutic range established for efavirenz is 1000-4000 ng/ml.</p>
	Genetic variations increase the risk of side effects. The standard dose leads to an efavirenz concentration in the toxic range in the majority of patients with this genotype.
<p>Determine the efavirenz plasma concentration if side effects occur and reduce the dose if needed. In 14 IM adults, a dose reduction to 400 mg/day (2/3rd of the standard dose) was sufficient to achieve therapeutic plasma concentrations and to reduce or resolve side effects. The therapeutic range established for efavirenz is 1000-4000 ng/ml.</p>
	Genetic variations increase the efavirenz plasma concentration and therefore the risk of side effects. However, the efavirenz plasma concentration remains within the therapeutic range for the majority of patients.

<li>For cutaneous administration:</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid fluorouracil.</p>
<p>NOTE: If a patient has two different genetic variations that lead to a non-functional DPD enzyme (e.g. *2A and *13), this recommendation only applies if the variations are on a different allele. If both variations are on the same allele, this patient actually has a gene activity score 1, for which no increased risk of severe, potentially fatal toxicity has been found with cutaneous use. These two situations can only be distinguished by determining the enzyme activity (phenotyping). This recommendation only applies if the patient has virtually no enzyme activity.</p>
<ul>
<li>For systemic administration:</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid fluorouracil and capecitabine. Tegafur is not an alternative, as this is also metabolised by DPD.</p>
<p>If it is not possible to avoid fluorouracil and capecitabine: determine the residual DPD activity in mononuclear cells from peripheral blood and adjust the initial dose accordingly.</p>
<p>A patient with 0.5% of the normal DPD activity tolerated 0.8% of the standard dose (150 mg capecitabine every 5 days). A patient with undetectable DPD activity tolerated 0.43% of the standard dose (150 mg
capecitabine every 5 days with every third dose skipped)</p>

<p>If it is not possible to avoid azathioprine and mercaptopurine: use 10% of the standard dose and advise patients to seek medical attention when symptoms of myelosuppression (such as severe sore throat in combination with fever, regular nosebleeds and tendency to bruising) occur. Any adjustment of the initial dose should be guided by toxicity (monitoring of blood counts) and efficacy.</p>
<p>Note: The percentage of 10% is based on the analogy with TPMT, for which the gene variants have a comparable effect on toxicity to those of NUDT15. A percentage of &lt; 20% was calculated for NUDT15 PM, but there were insufficient data available to calculate the exact percentage.
Note: Dose adjustment based on the total of 6-TGN metabolites is not possible for these patients, as they develop toxicity within the therapeutic range that applies for patients without gene variants.</p>
	Grade &ge;2 leukopaenia occurs in 96% of these patients with standard therapy. The genetic variation increases the concentration of the fully activated metabolite of azathioprine and mercaptopurine.

	The guideline does not provide a description of the impact of a normal metabolizer phenotype on mercaptopurine.
<p>Choose an alternative or start with 10% of the standard dose. Any adjustment of the initial dose should be guided by toxicity (monitoring of blood counts) and effectiveness. If the dose is decreased: advise patients to seek medical attention when symptoms of myelosuppression (such as severe sore throat in combination with fever, regular nosebleeds and tendency to bruising) occur.</p>
	Grade ≥ 2 leukopaenia and intolerance occurred in 98% of these patients with standard therapy. The gene variation increases the quantities of the active metabolites of azathioprine and mercaptopurine.
<p>IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Start with 50% of the standard dose. Adjustment of the initial dose should be guided by toxicity (monitoring of blood counts) and effectiveness. Dose adjustment is not required for doses lower than 1.5 mg/kg per day for azathioprine or 0.75 mg/kg per day for mercaptopurine.
LEUKAEMIA: Start with 50% of the standard mercaptopurine dose, or start with the standard dose and reduce to 50% if side effects necessitate a dose reduction. It is not known whether dose reduction in advance results in the same efficacy as dose reduction based on toxicity. The initial dose should be adjusted based on toxicity (monitoring of the blood counts) and efficacy. Note: more stringent dose reductions are necessary if the patient is also NUDT15 IM or NUDT15 PM.</p>
	Grade ≥ 2 leukopaenia occurs in 23% of these patients with normal therapy for immunosuppression. The genetic variation increases the quantity of the active metabolites of azathioprine and mercaptopurine

	The plasma concentration of quetiapine is 3.2-fold higher in these patients. In addition, the formation of the active metabolite N-desalkylquetiapine, which is probably
responsible for the antidepressant effect, should be reduced. The gene variation results in reduced activity of the enzyme CYP3A4, which converts quetiapine to N-desalkylquetiapine
and an inactive metabolite.
<p>NO action is needed for this gene-drug interaction.</p>
	This gene variation reduces the conversion of quetiapine to inactive metabolites and a metabolite with anti-depressant effect. However, the effect on the plasma concentration
of quetiapine is limited (20% increase) and it is not known whether this has any clinical consequences. The relationship between the plasma concentration and clinical effect is
weak for quetiapine.

	The percentage of patients with therapy failure increases from 16% to 37%. The gene variation leads to a high ratio of the active metabolite (9-hydroxyrisperidone (paliperidone)) compared to risperidone, which crosses the blood-brain barrier more effectively.
<p>NO action is needed for this gene-drug interaction.</p>
	There is little evidence to support an increase in side effects caused by the gene variation. The gene variation may lead to a decrease in the required maintenance dose. However, as the effect on the dose is smaller than that of the normal biological variation, action is not useful.

Consider any additional risk factors for statin-induced myopathy.
Atorvastatin is affected less severely by the SLCO1B1 gene variation, but is also affected by CYP3A4 inhibitors such as amiodarone, verapamil and diltiazem. Use of atorvastatin is not recommended for patients with additional risk factors for statin-induced myopathy.
Rosuvastatin and pravastatin are influenced to a lesser extent by the SLCO1B1 gene variation. They are also not influenced by CYP3A4 inhibitors such as amiodarone, verapamil and diltiazem.

</ol>
	When using simvastatin 80 mg/day, the risk of myopathy is increased 30-fold to 18% and the risk of severe myopathy is increased 48-fold to 12%.

<p>RECOMMENDATION LIVER TRANSPLANTATION
In addition to the patient’s genotype, the metabolism of tacrolimus is also determined by the genotype of the transplanted liver.
LIVER is also of the genotype HETEROZYGOUS EXPRESSOR: Use 1.5 times the normal initial dose. Adjustment of the dose should then be based on therapeutic drug monitoring.<br />
If LIVER has a DIFFERENT genotype: There is insufficient evidence in the literature to support a dose recommendation.<br />
RECOMMENDATION INDICATIONS OTHER THAN LIVER TRANSPLANTATION
Use 1.5 times the initial dose that would yield the desired result in non-expressers. Adjustment of the dose should then be based on therapeutic drug monitoring. Adjustment of the dose should then be based on therapeutic drug monitoring.
For example: A Dutch study found a median trough concentration for tacrolimus of 14.7 ng/mL after 3 days at an initial dose of 0.15 mg/kg twice daily for 29 kidney transplant patients who were heterozygous expressers. Their target value was 10 - 15 ng/mL.</p>
	An increase of the initial dose can result in an increased chance of reaching a tacrolimus concentration within the target range before the start of therapeutic drug monitoring. However, there is no direct evidence that this results in improved clinical results. The genetic variation results in increased conversion of tacrolimus to inactive metabolites and therefore in a higher required dose.
<p>LIVER TRANSPLANTATION
In addition to the patient’s genotype, the metabolism of tacrolimus is also determined by the genotype of the transplanted liver.
LIVER is also of the genotype HOMOZYGOUS EXPRESSOR: Use 2.5 times the normal initial dose. Adjustment of the dose should then be based on therapeutic drug monitoring.
LIVER has a DIFFERENT genotype: There is insufficient evidence in the literature to support a dose recommendation.</p>
<p>OTHER TRANSPLANTATION
Use 2.5 times the initial dose that would yield the desired result in non-expressers. Adjustment of the dose should then be based on therapeutic drug monitoring. For example: One Dutch study found a median trough concentration for tacrolimus after three days of 9.4 ng/mL at an initial dose of 0.15 mg/kg twice daily for 5 homozygous kidney transplant patients. Their target value was 10 - 15 ng/mL.</p>
	An increase of the initial dose can result in an increased chance of reaching a tacrolimus concentration within the target range before the start of therapeutic drug monitoring. However, there is no direct evidence that this results in improved clinical results.
