<h4 id=""other-considerations"">Other Considerations</h4>
<p>This recommendation includes the use of tacrolimus in kidney, heart, lung and hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients, and liver transplant patients where the donor and recipient genotypes are identical. Further dose adjustments or selection of alternative therapy may be necessary due to other clinical factors (e.g., medication interactions, or hepatic function). Typically with other CYP enzymes, a normal metabolizer would be classified as having normal metabolism, and therefore, the drug dose would not change based on the patient‚Äôs genotype. However, in the case of CYP3A5 and tacrolimus, a CYP3A5 expresser (i.e., CYP3A5 normal metabolizer or intermediate metabolizer) would require a higher recommended starting dose, and the CYP3A5 non-expresser (i.e., poor metabolizer) would require the standard recommended starting dose.</p>

In addition to the patient‚Äôs genotype, the metabolism of tacrolimus is also determined by the genotype of the transplanted liver.
LIVER is also of the genotype HOMOZYGOUS EXPRESSOR: Use 2.5 times the normal initial dose. Adjustment of the dose should then be based on therapeutic drug monitoring.
LIVER has a DIFFERENT genotype: There is insufficient evidence in the literature to support a dose recommendation.</p>
<p>OTHER TRANSPLANTATION
Use 2.5 times the initial dose that would yield the desired result in non-expressers. Adjustment of the dose should then be based on therapeutic drug monitoring. For example: One Dutch study found a median trough concentration for tacrolimus after three days of 9.4 ng/mL at an initial dose of 0.15 mg/kg twice daily for 5 homozygous kidney transplant patients. Their target value was 10 - 15 ng/mL.</p>
"	An increase of the initial dose can result in an increased chance of reaching a tacrolimus concentration within the target range before the start of therapeutic drug monitoring. However, there is no direct evidence that this results in improved clinical results. The genetic variation results in an increased conversion of tacrolimus to inactive metabolites and therefore a higher required dose.	DPWG	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	Normal Metabolizer
