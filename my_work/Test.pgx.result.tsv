All studies correlating UGT1A1 genotypes with atazanavir adverse events have involved ritonavir boosting. However, concentration-time profiles are equivalent when boosted with either cobicistat or ritonavir (PMID 23532097), and bilirubin-related adverse events including discontinuation of atazanavir occur in a similar percentage of patients prescribed atazanavir with cobicistat or ritonavir (PMID 23532097). Associations between UGT1A1 genotype, bilirubin elevations, and atazanavir/r discontinuation therefore almost certainly translate to atazanavir/cobicistat."
