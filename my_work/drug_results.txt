The gene variation reduces the excretion of uric acid by kidneys and intestines, meaning that a stronger inhibition of the uric acid production by allopurinol is required to achieve the desired uric acid concentration.	Decreased Function	"Use 1.25 times the standard dose.<br />This equates to a dose titration schedule of 100, 200, 400 and 500 mg/day instead of the usual schedule of 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg/day."

Decreased Function	"Prescribe ≤20mg as a starting dose and adjust doses of rosuvastatin based on disease-specific and specific population guidelines. If dose &gt;20mg needed for desired efficacy, consider combination therapy (i.e., rosuvastatin plus non-statin guideline directed medical therapy) (PMID: 30423391).
