<p>Due to X-linked mosaicism, individuals with more than one X chromosome (e.g., females, individuals with Klinefelter syndrome) and heterozygous for one non-deficient (class IV) and one deficient (class I–III) allele may display a normal or a deficient phenotype; an enzyme activity test is needed to assign G6PD phenotype in such cases.
