She had recurrent major depressive episodes since age 30, and since age 43 had clinical worsening, including worsening response to treatment despite alternative antidepressants and mood stabilizers. She was treated with clomipramine 75 mg/day i.v., the max permitted dose, but only a partial response was achieved. Steady-state level of clomipramine + desmethylclomipramine was 139 ng/mL (reference range 230-450 ng/mL). Pharmacogenetic analyses were performed according to CPIC guidelines. She was found to homozygous for CYP1A2*1F, suggesting increased enzyme activity, as well as CYP2D6 rs1080985 CG (increased activity), CYP2C19*1/*17 (increased activity), and CYP3A5*1/*3 (increased activity). She was switched to oral intake at 225 mg daily (normal suggested maintenance dose is 100 mg daily), after which plasma levels were within the therapeutic range (262 ng/mL). Annotation done on rs762551 (-163C>A). PharmVar released an updated CYP1A2 nomenclature 12/2024. At this point, -163 C>A was included in 26 core alleles with *30 being the SNP by itself.
